# Twisted Graphene App

This is an interactive web app to simulate **twisted bilayer and trilayer graphene**. You can:

- Adjust twist angles between layers.
- Apply strain to each layer independently.
- Visualize the resulting moiré patterns live.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/syedasadmaq/twisted_graphene_app.git
   cd twisted_graphene_app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

Then open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## Features

- ✅ Toggle between **bilayer** and **trilayer** systems.
- ✅ Adjustable strain and twist angle for each layer.
- ✅ Live interactive plots.
